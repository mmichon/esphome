# Mike's esphome configs

Some sample configs for ESP32/ESP8266 microcontrollers running [esphome](https://github.com/esphome/esphome), interfacing with [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/).

Example interfaces:
* Controlling a 'dumb' standing desk with relay switches [espinlaw.yml]
* Controlling an electric strike [espgarage.yml]
* Detecting an open car tailgate with an HC-SR04 [espcar.yml]
* Motion sensing with RCWL-0516 [espkitchen.yml]
* Controlling a garage door with a relay switch [espgarage.yml]
* Temperature sensing with DHT11 [espbedroom.yml]
* Temperature sensing with DS18B20 [espinlaw.yml]
* Controlling a TV with an IR transmitter [espinlaw.yml]
* Streaming via an ESP32-cam [espcam.yml]
* Sounding a simple home alarm via a piezoelectric speaker [espalarm.yml]
* Yet another LilyGo-T5 based epaper screen as a frontend for Home Assistant data [esppaper.yml]
